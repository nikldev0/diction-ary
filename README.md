# Dictionary Project
A dictionary app using the Fetch API from Merriam-Webster.

## Key Features

1. If the search query matches an entry in the Merriam-Webster learner's dictionary JSON data, we output definition and an audio file with pronunciation.

 2. If a search is attempted with no input, an alert is triggered:

 3. If there is no query match, suggested words are presented:

 ## Things learnt/practiced:
 
 1. Making calls with the Fetch API. 
 2. Performing AJAX calls with async and await.
 3. Parsing JSON data and selecting information necessary for the scope of the project. 
 
 ## Challenges I overcame: 
 
 1. Navigating the API object was sometimes difficult as there was much more information than I needed, as well as manipulating the array objects to present specific        data. I overcame this by consulting a list I made prior of the exact information I wanted to include. I also spent some time familiarsing myself with the API data to become more comfortable making the right extractions to the DOM.
